# My Dotfiles

I had a windows x ubuntu x Arch triple boot with i3wm in ubuntu and larbs script running in Arch.
Idk what happened but swap memory gave up and i being an idiot did not have my config files backed up. So i had to start with a basic installation of ubuntu 20.04.

[This file](bareubuntu.txt) contains commands i used to install all the basic components i mostly require(ROS, CUDA etc). Most of them are built from source because i wanted more control. The end of the file contains commands for version for easy tracking.

.config and i3config files contain configs for i3gaps. Most of the configs are the default ones and aren't modified too much. A lot of the inspiration for i3block, dunst, tmux, ranger, nvim came from [Luke's voidrice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice).
